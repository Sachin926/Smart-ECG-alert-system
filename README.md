# Smart-ECG-alert-system
Heart attack alert system for hospitals
Cost efficient as it can manage all the patients present in 100 meters range
We need only one GSM module for alering about all the patints available in that range


# setting up and using 
initially we need to enter the contact number of the doctor using the keypad present in the receiver having gsm module on which the alert message will be sent and we are good to go thereafter
